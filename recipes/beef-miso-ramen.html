        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Beef Miso Ramen is a savory and hearty Japanese noodle soup that features tender slices of beef and a rich, umami-packed miso broth. This dish combines the depth of red or white miso paste with a flavorful beef stock, creating a comforting base that is both complex and satisfying. Topped with fresh vegetables such as bok choy, green onions, and bean sprouts, along with soft-boiled eggs and sesame seeds, Beef Miso Ramen offers a balanced blend of textures and tastes. The springy ramen noodles absorb the broth, making each bite a delightful fusion of robust flavors and hearty ingredients.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) beef sirloin steak</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></sup> gluten-free soy sauce (tamari)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coconut oil</li>
            <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons miso paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine steak and soy sauce in a plastic container with a lid. For best flavor results, marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook until firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare. Remove from skillet and allow to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the steak is resting, combine broth, miso paste, garlic, and sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Once broth is at a slow boil, add ramen noodles. Cook until noodles are soft, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer broth and noodles to 2 bowls. Slice steak and place on top.</li>
        </ol>
